<h1><b>Project Designing: Soldering station</b></h1>

![20230607_132222](https://github.com/XanderPxl/Soldering_station_2023/assets/114076297/6cb3aa5f-44be-4e85-98cb-544377a2f90d)



This project aims to design a functional and durable
prototype soldering station that is based on the design that Elektor made a few years ago. 
Because the design has been in use for several years, it forms a stable base to start from. As a prototype it
needs to easily troubleshoot and repair in order to make the testing process
easier. In the application note I will not only discuss the final outcome and
the approach that it took to get here but also the different materials that
were used, as well as the different challenges and decisions encountered
throughout the different phases of the project.

The <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4142169">soldering iron holder</a> that can be seen in the picture is the design of <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/theswink/designs">Swinkels Wilfred</a> from Thingiverse.
