# Soldering Station

This project aims to design a functional and durable prototype soldering station that is based on the design that Elektor made a few years ago. Because the design has been in use for several years, it forms a stable base to start from. As a prototype it needs to easily troubleshoot and repair in order to make the testing process easier. In the application note I will not only discuss the final outcome and the approach that it took to get here but also the different materials that were used, as well as the different challenges and decisions encountered throughout the different phases of the project.
